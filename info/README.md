## Description
*Snow, but made of text! Rooms, but made of text! Stairs, but made of text! An elevator, but made of text! You’ll probably die, but made of text! These fragments I have shored against my ruins!*

*Burnt Matches* was written in [Twine](http://www.twinery.org) (1.4.2). It takes inspiration from _[Into Eternity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194612/)_, directed by Michael Madsen, and inspiration and text from [The Wasteland](http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html) by T. S. Eliot. The game was made as part of a Deep Time jam organised by the [Speculative Play](http://www.speculativeplay.com/) project at Concordia University.
