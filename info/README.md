*Burnt Matches* was written in [Twine](http://www.twinery.org) (1.4.2). It takes inspiration from _[Into Eternity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194612/)_, directed by Michael Madsen, and inspiration and text from [The Wasteland](http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html) by T. S. Eliot. The game was made as part of a Deep Time jam organised by the [Speculative Play](http://www.speculativeplay.com/) project at Concordia University.

*Burnt Matches* has been written about on [Kill Screen.](https://killscreen.com/articles/pippin-barrs-new-game-brings-concrete-poetry-life/)
